### Project Scope

This project is to demonstrate API integration using `node-fetch` and `axios`


#### Implements

```bash
node-fetch

# plus
axios

# plus
mui v5

# plus
Next.js 14 with AppRouter (React Server Components Out of the Box)

# plus
Linting

# pus 
Formik (Form without the tears) & Yup (Form Validation on steroids)

# plus
React Spinner, because loading shouldn't be boring

# Written in
TypeScript
```

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


### Getting Started

First, install dependencies

```bash
npm i
# or
yarn (I recommend)
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev (I recommend)
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Entry to the code (i.e. code that renders the landing page) is at `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
